# next-tick-2

Environment agnostic nextTick polyfill

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/mreinstein/next-tick-2.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mreinstein/next-tick-2)

A commonjs module that provides nextTick functionality in the node and the browser.

- When run in Node.js `process.nextTick` is used
- In modern browsers microtask resolution is guaranteed by `MutationObserver`
- In other engines `setImmediate` or `setTimeout(fn, 0)` is used as fallback.
- If none of the above is supported module resolves to `undefined`

## why next-tick-2?

The original `next-tick` module includes the node `process` module, which causes `browserify`
to shim the module. It results in a larger bundle size, with unused code.

The original maintainer is not interested in fixing the problem. As a result the browserified code
that relies on `next-tick-2` is _significantly_ smaller than that generated by `next-tick`.
